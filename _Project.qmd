## Abstract

Being able to mitigate anxiety associated with any given activity is always a desirable outcome. Considering the frequency of anticipatory anxiety in daily life, it is worth investigating whether the ability to choose—and thus exert some level of control—can reduce negative emotional responses. The analysis in this report finds that choice does not play a significant role in managing or reducing the effects of anxiety that precedes an activity with perceived displeasure.

## Initial Data Analysis

The data was sourced through an experimental survey examining 337 participants on the effects of choice on socially acquired nocebo effects in the context of cybersickness in Virtual Reality (VR) (Saunders, 2023). In general, the dataset was well structured and documented with sound integrity, though some changes had to be made.

    This investigation has a unique focus on anxiety. Experimentally, our report examines how choice plays a role in modulating the level of anxiety participants have to experiencing VR having understood possible symptoms associated with the activity. The variables of Choice, VR Environment, VR Anxiety (Level), Baseline/Active/Delta Anxiety, and Age were all considered. In particular, a reclassification of Age from a quantitative continuous variable to a qualitative nominal was done. A new variable was created, representing a combination of Choice and VR Environment, but this is only used to aide in graphing. All other data types were maintained: Choice as qualitative nominal, VR Environment as qualitative nominal, VR Anxiety as quantitative discrete, and B/A/D Anxiety as quantitative discrete.

This dataset and analysis is only somewhat limited by the sample size, especially taking into account the age of participants. This is accounted for by the choice to include only participants between the ages 15-40, as there was a lack of older subjects and thus have little statistical significance. The decision to turn age into a qualitative nominal variable was undertaken in order to remedy inconsistent numbers of people in each specific age. Additionally, there were errors with the variable names and descriptions. The data dictionary had the definitions of p_e and p_stai swapped, which was verified by the calculations used to generate these variables returning correct values for the name of expression but not description. These were expect - BE and stai - baseline_stai respectively. In addition, the variabls BVRA and PVRA had aliases baseline_vra and p_vra, which was remedied by the agreement to only use the first forms. Despite the slight changes in methodology for each experimental set, we assume within this report that pooled experimental data is representative between the separate trials.

Our analysis found that there was little to no relationship between either the ability to choose or the VR environment to the level of anxiety change. However, it is notable that the range for change in anxiety for those experiencing a sunny environment was somewhat greater than those with a snowy environment. This is likely to be a result of natural variation in the dataset and thus there is a low chance to be an underlying mechanism for this phenomenon. There also appears to be little correlation between age and anxiety.

A more detailed look at the data finds that the mean change in anxiety in participants who were given the ability to choose was `r mean(filter(data, data$choice == "Choice")$vranxiety) # ≈ 2.096` compared to `r mean(filter(data, data$choice == "No Choice")$vranxiety) # ≈ 1.955446` for those who did not. As there is only a slight difference, we demonstrate that choice has little to no bearing on the amount of anxiety a person experiences with regards to an activity that may cause distress or other side effects such as cybersickness.

Our analysis within this report found that typically no correlation between different environments and change in anxiety. Although, notably the range for change in anxiety for those with a sunny environment was much greater than those with a snowy environment, indicating a small correlation. Moreover, the analysis conveyed that the spreads of the data decreased for both environments when given the choice to choose. As such the environment the user experiences has little association with the change in anxiety, although when given a choice a more decisive result may occur although the data is not strong enough to confirm this.

## Conclusion

There is a negligible influence on change in anxiety levels due to the VR environment, as the average change in anxiety levels of different environments are very similar. It is notable that anxiety in general increased for all participants, however it is likely to be explained by the nature of the environment; A rollercoaster is likely to produce feelings of sickness and therefore anxiety. Although factors apart from environment, and choice might have played a larger role in the resultant anxiety level due to the relatively low change found in the respective variables (Kwon, 2020). This also does not take into account one's perception of the reality of the environment, as a more accurate recreation would increase anxiety (Matteo Girondini et al., 2023). We came to a consensus that our findings reflect that there is likely little to no relation between choice nor environment and anxiety.

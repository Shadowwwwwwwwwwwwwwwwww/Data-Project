## Abstract

Our analysis within this report found that typically no anxiety change relationship could be found between enviroments. Although, notably the range for change in anxiety for those with a sunny environment was much greater than those with a snowy environment, indicating a small correlation. Moreover, the analysis conveyed that the spreads of the data decreased for both environments when given the choice to choose. As such the environment the user experiences has little association with the change in anxiety, although when given a choice a more decisive result may occur although the data is not strong enough to confirm this.


## Initial Data Analysis

The data was sourced through an experimental survey examining 337 partiicipants for the VR nocebo affect. Our investigation has a unique focus on age groups within the experiments, and how a VR environment may cause a impact on the fluctuation of the participants reported anxiety levels. With these variables we had to reclassify age from a quantitative continuous variable into a qualitative nominal to utilize groups for which the anxiety changed, while the rest remained. These being the VR environment as a qualitative nominal, and the anxiety level's quantitative discrete variable, and choice as a qualitative nominal.

    **Overview**
 Our investigation has a unique focus on age groups within the experiments, and how a VR environment may cause a impact on the fluctuation of the participants anxiety reported levels. With these three variables we had to reclassify age from a quantitative continuous variable into a qualitative nominal to utilize the ages as groups for which the anxiety changed, while the rest remained as they were. These being the VR environment as a qualitative nominal, and the anxiety level's which is a quantitative discrete variable.

    **Limitations**
This study is limited by its sample size, this entails that the experiment will not be able to get perfectly accurate results. Furthermore, external factors like mood and behaviors before entering the VR simulation will not be able to be controlled, as such the data could vary depending on the sets of age groups.


    **Assumption**
 Within this report there was an assumption that people were honest with their symptoms, and variation in anxiety levels. Along with having any non permitted knowledge on how the test is conducted beyond what has been told. Furthermore, it is assumed that neither the conductors or participants had any bias on the data. It is also assumed the test were completed in the same conditions, such that no co-founding variables would have altered the data sets. Additionally, data cleaning had to take place to remove outliers, these were anxiety levels that were outside of the possible range, as these were assumed to be a mistake. Furthermore, the data was concluded down to the age groups between 15 and 40 as these had the most data, and were deemed the most representative of real world scenarios.


## Research Question (Abstract)

The data conveyed that the change in anxiety levels between users of sunny, and snowy environments varied by minuscule amounts. This is shown inor the median, mean, and quartiles of the data. The average median among all age groups for sunny environments was a change of 1.4, while snowy was 1.6, revealing that snowy environments had a slightly higher change. Furthermore, the average range of IQR was 3.6 for sunny environments, and 3.1 for snowy. This implies that snowy environments more narrow IQR may be a resultant of a slightly more decisive, consistent and reduced overall change. Hence, the small difference in median, and IQR range indicate that system environment has little to no correlation with anxiety level changes. Furthermore, the data implied that little change would result from a choice, as the average median for participants who chose was, 1.833 on the anxiety test while it was 1.5 for those who did not, illustrating a negligible relationship. Whereas the average range of IQR for those who chose was 3.1, whereas it was 3.9 for those who did not get to choose. These two contrast each other and suggest a possible correlation in variability for participants who do not choose the environment.

Our findings conclude that there is a negligible influence on change in anxiety levels due to the system environment. Due to the tendency of the average data to remain similar from the comparatives, therefore it is not possible to determine any large correlation. Additionally, people with a higher initial anxiety level tended to have the largest change. Although factors apart from system environment, and choice might have played a larger role in the resultant anxiety level due to the relatively low change found in the respective variables (Kwon, 2020). Furthermore, our findings reflect that choice had a small effect, producing narrower max, min's, and IQR's, conveying a possible relationship. Where someone's previous experience might manipulate the variability in the data due to experiences from similar environments (Matteo Girondini et al., 2023).

Overall, we came to a consensus that our findings reflect that volition might have an impact on the variability of anxiety level, where a lack of choice leads to higher variability while having a choice leads to more consistent levels. Although the changes are small they do indicate a psychological variability in the response. Whereas the actual environment will most likely not affect the change in anxiety levels.

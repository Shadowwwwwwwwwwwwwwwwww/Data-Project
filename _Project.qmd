## Abstract

(Found as "Executive Summary" in the criteria)

Max 50 words: Clear, interesting summary of the main insights/findings from the report.\

1.  The ES is a quick, snappy summary for a busy manager. The rest of the report is the supporting evidence.
2.  You can choose what format to use (eg a paragraph or bullet points). However, it must all be cohesive and clear.

## Research Question (Abstract)

Explores a research question, using numerical and/or graphical summaries (i.e., ggplot, gganimation, maps) which give insight.\

You have freedom to approach this task however you'd like to. You will be marked on whether you 'skillfully dealt with the research data.'\

Overall: 1. The total word count is 350 words. 2. Coding and R output is not included in the word count.

## Initial Data Analysis

Max 200 words: Discusses source, structure and limitations of data collection. Defines meaning of key variables. Describes any assumptions, and any data cleaning.

1.  Source' means where the data came from.
2.  'Structure' means the overall size of the dataset, and the type of variables, including any reclassification needed in R. You can focus on just the variables needed for your research questions.
3.  'Limitations' means the issues which may affect confidence in and interpretation of the data.
4.  'Assumptions' is any ideas about the data for which we don't yet have evidence. For example, you collect 100 students shoe sizes, 90 students shoe size range between 6-12 but 10 are outliers at 30 - 45. You may make the assumption that they have incorrectly entered european sizes.
5.  'Data cleaning' is changing the data from its original format. You do not need to list every change (eg change of classification can be noted in the code chunk), rather discuss the overall nature of changes with reasons.

## Professional Standard of Report

1\. The report is well edited with a high standard of spelling and grammar.
2. The word counts are respected, and there is no extraneous output.
3. The research is interesting, and carefully and thoughtfully implemented.
4. There is a short statement explaining how 1 of the Shared Values and 1
of the Ethical Principles has been adhered to (see ISI: <https://isi-web.org/declaration-professional-ethics>)
